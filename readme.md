# Redlining

Traffic kills a _lot_ of people, particularly boys and men between ages 5-49. Also, within Chicago, there
are more crashes (and more severe crashes) in historically redlined areas than there are in blue lined
areas. Why should redlining -- a practice from 100 years ago -- impact health outcomes in modern times?

This talk (and slightly messy repo) contains notebooks and data I used to provide a plausible explanation
of this trend to a lay audience at the Chicago History Museum on May 11th, 2024. In the talk, I sketched
out the connection between traffic fatalities and the built environment, highlighting how the ways we
construct roads and traffic networks heavily influence health outcomes. This leads to a simple but tentative
explanation: disinvestment in redlined areas may have led to less safe infrastructure, leading to the
disparities we observe today.
